Implementing neural networks without using any pre built libraries and just using pandas and numpy

This project was inspired by and partially based on the Kaggle notebook 
["Building a Neural Network FROM SCRATCH (no TensorFlow/PyTorch...)"]([https://www.kaggle.com/code/koki25ando/neural-network-from-scratch](https://www.kaggle.com/code/wwsalmon/simple-mnist-nn-from-scratch-numpy-no-tf-keras))

I adapted and extended parts of the implementation for learning purposes. 
Full credit goes to Samson Zhang for the original ideas and code structure.
